============================
Compatability
============================
* Should work on any OS that supports Python 3.5.2 and tkinter
* Requires installation of a font
* Requires python-rtmidi and pyserial, which are OS agnostic libraries.
* UI tested under windows. Should be fairly agnostic but different OSes will slightly change UI elements.

============================
Installation and running
============================
* Install and use Python 3.5.2 (32bit). Other versions should work.
* Install Consola font family. It is included in libs/fonts folder.
* Requires 1920x1080 resolution, but work is being done to make it resolution agnostic.
* Requires pip-install python-rtmidi (Tested with version 1.1.0)
* Requires pip-install pyserial (Tested with version 3.4)

================================
Running
================================
Consists of 3 main programs
* main.py - the gui
* midi-daemon.py - talks to the keyboard
* dmx-daemon.py - talks to the dmx widget

Simply run "run-all.bat" on windows or "./run-all" on Unix-based systems

Other:
* If you don't have a desk, you can use DeskEmulator/DeskEmulator.py to emulate desk sliders
